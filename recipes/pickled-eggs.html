    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Hard boil and peel the eggs.  It's best to do this with a
            tablespoon of vinegar to soften the shells while cooking.</li>
        <li>cut onion into rings, crush the garlic cloves.  Put them
            in a pot with the vinegar, salt, and water.  Simmer until
            the onions become soft and translucent</li>
        <li>Add the fluid to the mason jar.  Add in peeled eggs and
            onions/garlic in layers, until the jar is as stuffed as
            possible</li>
        <li>Chill in the fridge for at least a week.
            Eggs should stay good for 3 months.</li>
